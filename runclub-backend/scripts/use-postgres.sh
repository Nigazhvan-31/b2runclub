# Switches this backend from SQLite to Postgres (Supabase).
#
# Two things have to change together, and changing only one produces a confusing
# failure at deploy time rather than here:
#
#   1. prisma/schema.prisma      provider "sqlite" -> "postgresql"
#   2. prisma/migrations/00_init the SQLite CREATE TABLEs -> the Postgres ones
#
# The migration matters because `npm start` runs `prisma migrate deploy`. Left as
# SQLite SQL it would be replayed against Postgres and fail partway through,
# leaving a half-built database.
#
# This is one-way for the running app: after this, `file:./dev.db` no longer
# works, so your local setup and any SQLite deployment need the Postgres URL too.
# Nothing is deleted — dev.db is left alone and git has the previous version.
