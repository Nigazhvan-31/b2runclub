/**
 * Ask Razorpay whether a PENDING booking has in fact been paid, and settle it.
 *
 * Both existing routes to PAID need something to come to us: the webhook needs
 * Razorpay to call in, and `/verify` needs the member's browser to survive
 * Checkout and post the callback. When neither happens the money is captured at
 * Razorpay and the registration sits at PENDING for ever — the ticket route
 * refuses anything that is not PAID or FREE, so the member is charged and gets
 * no QR code. Worse, Checkout will not let them retry: Razorpay rejects a
 * second payment against an order it has already been paid for, so there is no
 * way out from the member's side at all.
 *
 * Losing that callback is ordinary, not exotic. A UPI payment on a phone hands
 * off to GPay or PhonePe, and the browser tab that has to run the callback is
 * frequently evicted while the member is in the other app. Bigger totals — a
 * party booking — are likelier to be paid that way than by a saved card, which
 * is why group bookings were the ones noticed as stuck.
 *
 * So this asks the gateway directly, which is the only authoritative answer, and
 * needs no signature because nothing in the request is trusted: the order id
 * comes from our own row and the payment state comes from Razorpay over an
 * authenticated call. Safe to run repeatedly, and safe to run on a booking that
 * was never paid — it simply reports that nothing was found.
