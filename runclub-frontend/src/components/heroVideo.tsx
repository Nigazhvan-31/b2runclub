  /*
   * No edge mask. The clip fills the hero outright.
   *
   * It used to be feathered by a radial mask — an ellipse inscribed in the box,
   * which meant the four corners could never be reached and the picture always
   * read as an oval. Successive passes widened the opaque plateau from 38% to
   * 88% of the radius chasing that, which is the shape asking to be dropped
   * rather than tuned.
   *
   * Removing the mask on its own would have been worse than keeping it, and the
   * other two changes here are what make "no border" actually look like no
   * border:
   *
   *   1. Full-bleed. The hero section is `mx-auto max-w-7xl`, so this layer was
   *      1280px wide with page either side. Unmasked and container-width, the
   *      left and right edges become hard vertical lines at x=80 and x=1360 on
   *      a 1440 screen — a rectangle floating mid-page. `left-1/2 w-screen
   *      -translate-x-1/2` spans the viewport instead, putting those edges
   *      where a hard cut is unremarkable. The Shell clips overflow-x, so the
   *      ~15px of 100vw that a desktop scrollbar accounts for is trimmed rather
   *      than adding a scrollbar.
   *
   *   2. No darkening wash over the picture. The clip plays at full strength;
   *      the only thing on top of it is a 64-80px dissolve at the very bottom
   *      edge, which is there because that edge is otherwise a hard horizontal
   *      line the full width of the screen. Earlier versions of that gradient
   *      spanned most of the frame and were narrowed three times — 72px, 46px,
   *      31px — before being dropped and then reinstated as a border alone.
   *
   *   3. The hero sizes itself to the clip's own aspect ratio, reported through
   *      `onAspect`. `object-fit: cover` fills the box and crops the overflow,
   *      so a 16:9 clip in a 2.8:1 hero lost 37% of its frame height at 1440
   *      and 45% at 1920 — off the top and bottom, since object-position
   *      defaults to centre. With the box matching the ratio there is nothing
   *      left to crop vertically. The hero then asks for 80% of that height on
   *      purpose, trimming the top fifth — sky and treetops — and
   *      `object-bottom` is what puts the whole trim there rather than
   *      splitting it between top and bottom as centred cover would.
   *
   * The events pill carries its own near-opaque background rather than
   * borrowing contrast from a wash, which is what let the wash go. Gold text on
   * an 8% gold tint measured 1.6:1 over sunlit footage. See Landing.tsx.
   *
   * The left and right edges land at the viewport and the top sits below the
   * sticky navbar, so neither needs anything.
